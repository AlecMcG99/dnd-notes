“

Beshaba, like Tymora, arose from the corrupted form of Tyche. Once Tymora came forth, all that was tainted by [Moander](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moander "Moander") coalesced and stepped out as the goddess of ill fortune, Beshaba. Beshaba was lovely to behold, but her heart was malicious and spiteful. Beshaba and Tymora hated one another instantly and tried to destroy each other. Fortunately other powerful gods were present at the time and helped separate the battling sisters. Beshaba fled to live on the dark planes, which were more suited to her spirit.

## Description

Beshaba appeared as a young, tall, slim, and beautiful maiden with a wild mane of pure white hair. The woman was pale, had a small waist and voluptuous shape. Her corpse-like pale skin was countered by flushed hues of blue and violet on the cheeks and throat. Beshaba's most prominent feature were her yellow-rimmed eyes that were ablaze with insanity. She was adorned in a tight gown that snugly wrapped her body in pitch-black fabric. She wore a tiara of [black pearls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pearl "Pearl").<sup id="cite_ref-tymora-p8_14-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-tymora-p8-14">[14]</a></sup>

## Personality

Beshaba was a spiteful, petty and purportedly insane goddess whose actions often seemed random to onlookers. Her primary motivation however was jealousy, specifically towards her sister for her more favorable public reception, and so she demanded equal lip service (if not actual veneration) lest she curse the offenders.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-42_3-4"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-42-3">[3]</a></sup> Unlike her sister Tymora, who happily shared her gifts with her own worshipers as well as her godly allies, Beshaba hoarded her divine powers, creating a reserve.<sup id="cite_ref-tymora-p148_15-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-tymora-p148-15">[15]</a></sup>

## Relationships

Beshaba, who was said to have gotten Tyche's looks where Tymora got her love, was considered to be attractive to many male deities and some have been devoured by her lustful passions. Mortals who perceived the Maid of Misfortune were often destroyed by their lust or driven to maddened loyalty.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-42_3-5"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-42-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F&amp;P-91_9-3"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-F&amp;P-91-9">[9]</a></sup>

She rejected advances from [Talos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos "Talos"), among other hopefuls.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-42_3-6"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-42-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F&amp;P-91_9-4"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-F&amp;P-91-9">[9]</a></sup>

Beshaba was the twin sister and sworn enemy of [Tymora](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tymora "Tymora").<sup id="cite_ref-FA-42_3-7"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-42-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F&amp;P-91_9-5"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-F&amp;P-91-9">[9]</a></sup>

She was [Tempus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tempus "Tempus")' lover.<sup id="cite_ref-FRCG-p80_6-2"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FRCG-p80-6">[6]</a></sup>

Beshaba was served by [alu-fiends](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alu-fiend "Alu-fiend") who were outfitted with [silver](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Silver "Silver") [breastplates](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Breastplate "Breastplate") decorated with the goddess' symbol - stag horns. Two of her loyal demonic servants were Okim and Airdna.<sup id="cite_ref-tymora-p7_16-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-tymora-p7-16">[16]</a></sup>

_Another depiction of a holy symbol of Beshaba_

Beshaba was revered more out of fear than out of religious faith. Her doctrine stated that bad luck befell everybody and the only way to avoid it was by worshiping her. She was renowned for being spiteful and malevolent, and her priests manipulated common folk into revering and providing for them by acting mysteriously and playing on morbid fears. Her [clerics](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clerics "Clerics") offered an entreaty for their spells and made sacrifices of alcoholic beverages such as burning [brandy](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brandy "Brandy") or [wine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wine "Wine"). There were two festivals in the calendar of Beshaba, at [Midsummer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer "Midsummer") and [Shieldmeet](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shieldmeet "Shieldmeet"). Both were celebrated by revelry and indulgence in food and drink.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-42_3-8"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-42-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F&amp;P-91_9-6"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-F&amp;P-91-9">[9]</a></sup>

[Red Wizards of Thay](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Wizards_of_Thay "Red Wizards of Thay") were known to erect shrines to Beshaba near their ritual chambers to ward off bad luck.<sup id="cite_ref-SCAG5e-p21,26-27_1-5"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-SCAG5e-p21,26-27-1">[1]</a></sup>

Giant black [stags](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Stag "Stag") with red eyes who could gore an [elephant](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elephant "Elephant") with ease served the goddess of misfortune and inhabited Beshaba's Blood Tor.<sup id="cite_ref-tymora-p106_17-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-tymora-p106-17">[17]</a></sup>

### Orders

-   Doommasters: The best known order of specialty priests, universally feared for the way they reveled in the infliction of misfortune on others.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-43-44_4-1"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-43-44-4">[4]</a></sup>
-   [Black Fingers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Fingers "Black Fingers"): Only by Beshaba's favor could some evil male clerics, thieves, and [fighters](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fighters "Fighters") join this secret order. They acted as [assassins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Assassins "Assassins") dedicated to their goddess's name.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-43-44_4-2"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-43-44-4">[4]</a></sup>
-   Wormlucks: In order to spread Beshaba's influence and counter the church of Tymora, the Wormlucks (or Priests of Bad Fortune) were created, serving as a focus for calamities that occurred wherever they went, often affecting them as well. Their style of dress was distinctive, forced upon them by the orthodox clergy to avoid confusion with them and for high visibility. They wore bright red robes worn over armor and white hair wigs, which had to be obvious and usually ill-fitting, to honor Beshaba's own locks.<sup id="cite_ref-WPotR-p70_18-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-WPotR-p70-18">[18]</a></sup>

_A cleric of Beshaba._

Beshaba came into being when the deity [Tyche](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tyche "Tyche") split during the [Dawn Cataclysm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dawn_Cataclysm "Dawn Cataclysm"), a separate disaster relating to the machinations of [Lathander](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lathander "Lathander"). Tyche was infected with a taint of the dark god [Moander](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moander "Moander") and was forced to split into two parts by her friend [Selûne](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sel%C3%BBne "Selûne"). Those two parts, Tymora and Beshaba, sprang out fully formed and immediately fought.<sup id="cite_ref-FA-42_3-9"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-FA-42-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F&amp;P-91_9-7"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-F&amp;P-91-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

In [1368 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1368_DR "1368 DR"), Doljust, an aging nobleman, displeased the goddess of ill-luck. Beshaba used her divine magics to twist the man's luck. She watched Doljust as he faced off against a [werebat](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Werebat "Werebat"). The creature's cave had two dead toddlers in front of it, which was a grim omen of things to come. The goddess swayed the noble's [hound](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dog "Dog"), forcing the beast to pounce at the lycanthrope as Doljust swung his [sword](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword "Sword"). As the man mourned his beloved dying dog, Beshaba's vengeance became apparent. Doljust swung his blade one again, at a sound that came from behind. A moment later, another, smaller werebat, cleaved by Doljust's sword, shifted back to its humanoid form. The adolescent werebeast was a young child who whispered "grandfather" as he died in his older relative's arms.<sup id="cite_ref-tymora_20-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-tymora-20">[20]</a></sup>

## Trivia

-   "Beshaba's bad breath!" was a common exclamation, when facing bad luck.<sup id="cite_ref-POR-p181_21-0"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba#cite_note-POR-p181-21">[21]</a></sup>
