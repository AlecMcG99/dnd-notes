We start off with Scott failing his stealth check at the top of the tree and the creatures at the camp saw him. 
We all hid and the imps start coming out of the caves too 
Our ranger starts running into the group of darklings/imps with dynamite in hand 

I sensed 
- 25 lemurs
- 10 imps 
- 3 darklings 
- 2 sea hags 
- And a large evil presence inside the cave

## The Fight 

We fight and kill some imps, YanYan charms one of the darklings and tries to convince him to call off the fight 
Lars immediately kills the charmed darkling
Our ranger friend shows up out of nowhere and throws his dynamite into a large group of approaching fiends and blows up 7/8 of them

We won and met up with the other group of our friends
