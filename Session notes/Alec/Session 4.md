We start off with Scott failing his stealth check at the top of the tree and the creatures at the camp saw him. 
We all hid and the imps start coming out of the caves too 
Our ranger starts running into the group of darklings/imps with dynamite in hand 

I sensed 
- 25 lemurs
- 10 imps 
- 3 darklings 
- 2 sea hags 
- And a large evil presence inside the cave
