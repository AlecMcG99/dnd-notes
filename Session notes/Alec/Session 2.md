Went back to the Graphite Tavern 
The Dad we helped is named Jack 
Jack: 
- Starosta: chief of the council

Barkeep Bob talking about the 'takings'
 - They've been happening for 80 years, since the demons started showing up
 - The Archbishop is an 'enemy of the state' but we didn't hear it from him 

### Meeting with Jack 

- Prior Abductions included the kids being stripped naked and acid holes being burned 
- All children were the kids of higher-ups in the town clergy 
- They've been strung up in public to cause fear 
- Theres a rumored camp of cultists?? that might be contributing to these killings
- Jack gives us a map with a mark directly north of [[Odessloe]] 
- Litinus Octoff - Archibishop
