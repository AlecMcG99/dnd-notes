Aftermath of the fight 

lots of fires and dead civilians/kids
I start looking at the Beelzebub 
has warts and festering blisters 
He has a couple of symbols carved into his arms that (from what I can tell) is associated with senseless violence 

I have a disease from the beelzebub 

A kid I was helping heal coughed up black stuff on me and died Theres a symbol on some of the people who came out of the chapel different than the one on the demon 

Bob comes over and looks at the symbol 
- Its the symbol of Gidorath 
- He is a greater demon 
Bob 4(Southern wizard Bob) comes out and tells us that:
- Its not good 
- its a mark that gets placed on sacrifices and when the sacrifices all die the dark ritual will be complete
