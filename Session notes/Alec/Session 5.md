We start by meeting up with the other group of friends 

Don Julio finds a note on the darklings that reads that the ritual is almost complete and that they D'tlet attacks tonight 

## The Camp 
Bob 3 - racist(in a grandma kinda way)
Steven - sniveling kid
Tony - rogue 
Twan - rogue 
Jeff - rogue

We see 3 spined devils heading toward the town and decide to head back and try to save the kid we assume they are going to kidnap. Tony and Twan stay back 
YanYan tries to naruto run through the trees and took the wrong path, fell and got seperated from the party 

## YanYans 'adventure'

YanYan is running through the woods and runs into a bear 
One piece Haki style stares him down and intimidates it away
Runs into a [[Blink Dog]] 
Charms it, fed it. It grabbed the meat and ran. 
Tames the [[Blink Dog]] with his pipes 
We have a [[Blink Dog]]! 

## Back to [[Odessloe]] 

Below the devil we see a Goat headed demon
