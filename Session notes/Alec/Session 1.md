A note gets passed to Don Julio 
*The Dark Miasma Churns soon, be wary*

DJ hails from from the blazers having just performed his ritual 

Approx. 60 years ago, there was an explosion that introduced a lot of fiends that changed the Wildemount forest. 

Man burst into bar crying about his boy getting abducted by fiends. I flipped my coin and decided to help him. We ran with him to the site where he last saw his kid.

The dad + 3 townsfolk split off into the woods 
VB, YanYan, and DJ follow tracks that YanYan found and encounter the fiend and rats (imps)
