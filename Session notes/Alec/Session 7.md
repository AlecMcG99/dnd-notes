Talking to Jeff, the guard from last night, we convince them to help us with the cave that we ran into already. Jeff and friends come with us as well as their Captain, a massive man named Durham.

YanYan tries to steal Lars' scroll and a hilarious chase scene ensues 

Durham and our crew roll up to the cave. We get to the ridge, seems unusually quiet, no crabs, or any animals. Using Divine Sense I sensed a general evil, I sense at least a couple of imps in the cave and 1 or 2 on the ridge next to us. 

We  strut into the cave and find a big glass container full of body parts of the children that were abducted
