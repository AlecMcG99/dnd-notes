# General Philosophy
The world appears to be a chaotic mess of random events and happenstance, but in actuality there is a universal/divine will that is guiding the overall trajectory of events towards pre-determined end-states. These overarching goals are almost completely unknown to mortals but the universe hints at its general trajectory through "random" happenings. Events that are important to the universe are guaranteed to happen, but how the world gets there can change. I read heavily into seemingly random events and tend to let games of chance 'help' me make large decisions.

# Backstory

## Community
The Lykkestein (Norwegian for "lucky stone") Mining Company is a community of mostly [[Orc]], [[Half-Orc]], and [[Dwarf]] miners, their families and a couple merchants and tradespeople that travel with the company to supply them with necessary goods and services to support such a community. The Lykkestein Company are a notoriously superstitious bunch who mostly follow [[Tymora]] and believe that the more successful miners in the company have her favor which causes them to find the most valuable metals and gemstones. They currently are mining on the north side of [[Silberquel Ridge]] and have been for the last 7 years. They have set up a decent sized long-term camp in the foot hills of the mountains.

My father, Tog Av-Hakken (Norwegian for "of the pickaxe"), was an [[Orc]] miner employed by the Lykkestein Mining Company where he quickly rose through the ranks because he frequently found some of the most valuable metals and gemstones and therefore was perceived to be blessed by [[Tymora]]. One day while mining, his pick struck a thin section of rock and broke it open into a mineshaft that looked to have been abandoned in a hurry by whoever was working there before. There were minecarts full of gold, silver and other gemstones that would make the company as much money as they normally earn in a year. He called his fellow miners in to start hauling it out while he explored deeper. As he delved deeper in to the mine, he felt a compulsion to push on a wall. The wall creaked open and revealed a small room with a pedestal in the center. On the pedestal was a ornate wooden box with velvet lining that held a large silver coin, the face of [[Tymora]] on one side and the black antlers of [[Beshaba]] inlaid on the other. He took it and told no one else from the company. 

In the months following him finding the coin, he experienced some of the best luck imaginable. He would win almost every game of chance he played, find even more precious minerals in the mines, and he even met
