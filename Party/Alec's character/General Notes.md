# General Philosophy
The world appears to be a chaotic mess of random events and happenstance, but in actuality there is a universal/divine will that is guiding the overall trajectory of events towards pre-determined end-states. These overarching goals are almost completely unknown to mortals but the universe hints at its general trajectory through "random" happenings. Events that are important to the universe are guaranteed to happen, but how the world gets there can change. I read heavily into seemingly random events and tend to let games of chance 'help' me make large decisions.
